Bonnie Sorensen, beloved beloved beloved mother, grandmother, aunt and friend, passed away during a scoliosis surgery on September 10, 2015. Her bright spirit, exquisite taste and love of family and entertaining will be greatly missed.

Bonnie was born to Carl and Thelma Koots and raised in Sylvan Lake, Alberta, Canada. She graduated from Sylvan Lake High School and earned a coveted spot as a flight attendant for United Airlines. She received a BS from Bellevue College, MBA at City University and had a successful career in the aerospace industry. Bonnie's profession as a stewardess, however, was a true highlight. She was an active and enthusiastic member of the Clipped Wings Seattle Chapter for several decades. 

She was preceded in death by her siblings, Dorinne Denton and Rodney Koots. She is survived by her beloved children, son Mark Sorensen and daughter Laura Clever, daughter-in-law Elisabeth Sorensen and three beautiful grandchildren: Marina and Nick Clever and Brooke Sorensen. She also leaves behind a sister-in-law, Norma Koots and numerous nieces and their families.

A celebration of Bonnie's life will take place later this year. Remembrances may be made to Clipped Wings Seattle Chapter or the National Scoliosis Foundation.
